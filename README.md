# Overview

Depression Clicker 2 is a game about getting as sad as possible, with a clicker-game style layout. 

Depression Clicker 2 is made in JavaScript and HTML, and can be run on almost any device. There are a lot of activities that you can do to get more sad in-game, including: getting a crocodile, talking to an old man, and yelling at random civilians. 
Sadness is measured in `points`, and you generally want to get the highest number of points possible. 

Most actions in-game also have notifications that are assigned to that specific action. These notifications can show what the user does, and what happens as a result of that action, and can show much more. 

## Development

Depression Clicker 2 has a built-in notification system. It can be called using `notificationSend("text")`, and should include text(replace text with the text). Calling this function will send a notification to the top of the page, and it will slide out after 5 seconds. Currently, other formatting is not supported by calling the function. 

Running and testing can currently be done by simply opening the file; no webserver necessary. Since the main functionality is coded into the HTML, it can be used solely without a webserver.

Editing it can be similar: Just open the file in a text editor, then save and open it when you are done. 

Lastly, if you want to be a developer or have suggestions for the game, please open an issue. Thank you!

# Reason behind the game

The main reason that I made this game was to improve on a very unpopular game made by someone on GitHub, which was named `Depression Clicker`. I wanted to improve the UI and make the game have more features, and I hope that I have accomplished that well enough. The original game is made here, credit to the original for the idea(no code was taken from it, though)

I also wanted to make this because I thought it would be funny to make. I hope to add more to this game or make improved games in the future.
